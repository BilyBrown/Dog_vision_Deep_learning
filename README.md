# Dog_vision_Deep_learning
A deep learning model workflow that goes through the problem of identifying dog breed based on an image

This is a project from a course I took to learn how to use TensorFlow to create a machine learning model on unstructured data.
It is based on the requirements for a Kaggle.com competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification)
The model scored fairly well in the competition. Where 0 is a perfect score this model scored 0.983 which is within the top 890 contributors for the competition.
It also identyfied my dogs. I think with pretty good accuracy, considering my dogs are mutts.
Cheers.
